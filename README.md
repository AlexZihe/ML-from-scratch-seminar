# ML-from-scratch-seminar
This repository is part of a "Machine Learning from Scratch" seminar at Harvard Medical School. In the seminar, a group of interested graduate students and postdocs develop minimal Python implementations of prominent ML models. The primary goal is to exemplify the learning dynamics, strengths and limitations of popular algorithms while keeping the involved computations "tractable".
