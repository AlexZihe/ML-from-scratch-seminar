# ML-from-scratch-seminar
This repository is part of a _Machine Learning from Scratch_ seminar at Harvard Medical School.

In the seminar, a group of interested graduate students and postdocs develop minimal Python implementations of popular ML models. The primary goal is to exemplify the learning dynamics, strengths and limitations of the algorithms while keeping the involved computations "tractable".
